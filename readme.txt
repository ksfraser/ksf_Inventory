WHAT DOES THIS MODULE DO?

The assumption is that you have a DEFAULT inventory location, and other locations.

This module will allow users to scan barcodes into a table of stock items.
The user will then be able to indicate if it is a partial or full inventory taken.
The inventory counts will be adjusted to match the stock taking.  Overages and shorts will be transfered to/from DEFAULT.
